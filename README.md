This project is aimed to expand the commands and functionality of the Python-Remote Administration Tool (RAT) which allows users to remotely access their devices and retrieve system information. The RAT includes two key components: a client application that operates on the userâ€™s device and a server application that manages communication between the client and server. Both components will be developed in Python. The project will be hosted on GitHub, enabling students to clone the repository, contribute enhancements, and collaborate in a shared learning environment.
