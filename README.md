This project is from https://github.com/FZGbzuw412/Python-RAT. This project focuses on the development and enhancement of a Remote Administration Tool (RAT). It involves setting it up, exploring its core functionalities, understanding the communication mechanisms between the client and server, enhancing its features, and examining the background processes and system interactions. Through this project, I aim to gain valuable hands-on experience in networking and system security.
